IsingModel is a simple project to teach me the basics of both git and C++. It's a loose port from some existing Java code that I had written a while back. 

To run, first compile using:

$ make

then run the resulting executable:

$ ./IsingMain

You can choose which quantities to output by setting the dataDisplayed variable to one of: 
ENERGY, MAGNETISATION, C_V, CHI, ALL
